# OpenCV-Art

While learning OpenCV, I came across an interesting blog post which mentioned that OpenCV can be used to draw all sorts of shapes, and colour them with RBG pixel tuples, simply by programming! Fascinated by this concept I decided to put together a simple Python script that displays a red/black grid with a green circle in the middle. 

Who says programmers can't make art?
