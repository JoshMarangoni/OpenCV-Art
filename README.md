### Play with OpenCV by making visual art!

While learning OpenCV, I came accross an interesting blog post that mentioned you can draw all sorts
virtually anything with OpenCV, simply by programming. Fascinated by this concept I decided to put 
together a simple Python script that displays a red/black grid with a green circle in the middle.
Who says programmers can't draw?
